### Scenario 1: The 1870 Brick Wall
- **Context**: 40 million Black Americans hit a data wall at the 1870 Census.
- **Visual**: Dark interface with a physical wall of data. Digital Griot AI scans NARA RG 105 (Freedmen's Bureau).
- **Action**: Light pierces the wall, revealing hidden ancestors.
- **Outcome**: Connection pre-1870 established.

### Scenario 2: Phonetic Triangulation (Gullah Watermen)
- **Context**: Oral history often distorts names. "Weathermen" vs "Watermen".
- **Visual**: Map of SC Coast. User input "Weathermen" triggers a "Logic Error".
- **Action**: Engine flags geography and suggests "Watermen" (Boatmen).
- **Outcome**: Maritime Underground Railroad connection verified.

### Scenario 3: The "Paper Genocide" Correction
- **Context**: Racial misclassification (e.g., "Negro" vs "Cherokee").
- **Visual**: Census records with "Negro" labels.
- **Action**: Cross-referencing Guion Miller Rolls over time-lapse.
- **Outcome**: Indigenous identity reclaimed; "Paper Genocide" corrected.

### Scenario 4: The Sovereign Asset (ERC-6551)
